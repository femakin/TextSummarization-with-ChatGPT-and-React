**Introduction**

In today's digital age, the abundance of information can be overwhelming. With the constant stream of news, research papers, social media updates, and online content, it can be tough to keep up and make sense of it all.

Hence, this is where a text summarization app comes in. With a text summarization app, users can quickly and easily condense large amounts of text into a shorter, easier-to-digest format. It can also improve comprehension by highlighting the main points and key takeaways from a piece of content, making it easier to retain information.

Also, Text summarization offers a solution by automating the condensation of lengthy texts into shorter, more manageable versions.


**The Plan**

In this tutorial, we will build a text summarization app in React using OpenAI's ChatGPT model.

We will learn how to:

- Set up a React project

- Install necessary dependencies,

- Send a text to the ChatGPT model, and

- Extract the summarized text from the model's response.

Additionally, we will discover ways to enhance the text summarization feature, including customizing summary length, condensing multiple texts at once, and saving and retrieving summaries.

**Prerequisites**

As a prerequisite to this tutorial, prior knowledge of React is required, and ensure you have Node.JS version 18+  installed.

## Overview of ChatGPT and its capabilities

Developed by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) is a large-scale language generation model. It utilizes the GPT-2 architecture and works on diverse datasets of web pages. Using ChatGPT, you can complete text, translate, summarize, and translate human-like text.

ChatGPT can answer complex questions conversationally. Its ability to understand the intended meaning behind human questions makes it groundbreaking.

Among the characteristics of ChatGPT is its ability to generate coherent and contextually appropriate text. Due to the wide variety of input styles and formats the model has learned, it can adapt to different input style formats and generate text that matches the context.

Another important capability of ChatGPT is that it generates grammatically correct and semantically meaningful text. Using the model to summarize a text is the perfect way to ensure it understands its meaning.

Aside from handling massive inputs, ChatGPT can also generate long-form text. Writing essays, articles, and even books is possible with it.

## Bootstrapping React Application

Using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/), let's create a react project by running the following command in your terminal:

```
npx create-react-app text-summarization
cd text-summarization
npm start
```

The command above creates a new React application called text-summarization using the <code>create-react-app</code> tool, navigates into the application, and starts a development server to see the changes we will make to the application in real-time on the browser.

## Getting started with ChatGPT

To get started with ChatGPT and also get your OpenAI API key, follow these steps:

- Log in or create a new account on [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/signup)
for a free account. By following the instructions, you'll get to your Dashboard.

- Click on your profile picture to view the menu bar, and then click View API Keys to proceed to the API Keys page.
